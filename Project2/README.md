# Project 2 - Unix Utilities

## Project description:

Full description can be found [here.](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/blob/master/initial-utilities/README.md) Only difference beign the naming scheme of the files, (wcat -> my-cat)

### TL;DR

Implementing the following UNIX commands:

* cat
* grep
* zip
* unzip

---

## How to run:

To run the project first compile the file of your choosing (my-cat.c, my-grep.c, my-zip.c or my-unzip.c) by running the command 

``make <name of command> (cat, grep, zip, unzip)``

or alternatively compile all of the files with 

``make all``

Then refer to the command specific documentation.

* [cat](#my-catc)
* [grep](#my-grepc)
* [zip](#my-zipc-my-unzipc)
* [unzip](#my-zipc-my-unzipc)

## my-cat.c

### Command usage:

``./my-cat.out <filename(s)>``

A simple cat command that prints the contents of any give file into the console.

Above is my-cat command showing its own source code. by running it with ``./my-cat.out my-cat.c``

---

## my-grep.c

### Command usage:
``./my-grep.out <pattern> <filename(s)>``

Simplified grep command that takes a pattern and prints all the lines in the input file(s) that contain the pattern. If no input files are specified grep wil read from stdin.

![my-grep working](img/my-grep.png)

Above is my grep command matching the pattern "foo" to the file "testfile.txt" that contains the following:

```
12345
abcfoobar
dog
cat
This is quite a long string to proof that the program works on longer strings aswell as short ones. It would be very foolish to submit a program that doesnt work as expected.
```

## my-zip.c & my-unzip.c

### Command usages:

`` ./my-zip.out <file1> [file2...]``

`` ./my-unzip.out <file1>`` 

 **Note: For the unzip command to work correctly the given file must be first zipped with the myzip command.**

It is recommended when using the zip command to redirect the output to a file as without redirecting the output will be printed to stdout. And then you wont have a file to unzip.
